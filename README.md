# angiosperm-traits

This project contains data files and source code for the comparative analysis of
binary traits in flowering plants in the context of phylogenetic generalized
linear modeling. The general idea is that OMI-transformed 
[values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvosa/sdmdl-angiosperm-data/master/data/niche_traits_merged.csv)
for 
[GIS data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EFPurfyxhClDBsxjEAXf00A3LL2MrkQw) 
at curated 
[localities](https://github.com/rvosa/sdmdl-angiosperm-data/tree/master/data/occurrences) 
are the predictors for three binary traits.
